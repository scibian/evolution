= Bug reporting and evolution

Unfortunately, due to lack of time and manpower, the Evolution “team” is not
able to handle upstream issues, and those should be reported directly to
upstream on https://bugzilla.gnome.org.

Basically, that involves all stuff not related to packaging and Debian
integration. That means that, usually, crashes, enhancements requests etc.
should be submitted there. Please also open a bug in the Debian BTS,
particularly if the problem that is likely to affect other users.  When
submitting such a report to the Debian BTS, please include a Forwarded:
pseudo-header at the beginning of the text of the report, with the URL
associated with the upstream, i.e.:

    Forwarded-To: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=<BUGID>

When submitting crashes bugs, always include backtraces (inline ine the GNOME
bugzilla) with all the relevant debugging packages (especially evolution-dbg,
all the libe*-dbg, libgtkhtml*-dbg). More information on backtraces can be
found at http://wiki.debian.org/HowToGetABacktrace
