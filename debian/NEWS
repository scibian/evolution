evolution (2.29.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Due to gnome-pilot not beeing recent enough in Debian, it is now disabled
  in evolution builds.

evolution (2.24.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Evolution 2.24 now uses an sqlite database to store the messages
  summaries, so at first restart it'll generate the database. That could
  take some time for large messages folders.

  Evolution 2.24 is a large upgrade, and touches many things, so, just in
  case, you should make sure:
  - to make a backup of current setup, either by using the integrated
    plugin or by backing up your $HOME/.evolution folders.
  - to shutdown Evolution completely before upgrading, using:
    evolution --force-shutdown
